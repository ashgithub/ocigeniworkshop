### Python File Refactoring
  - Refactor all the Python files ina given directory <ask>. Your job is to refactore each file  for clarity and instructional value using example files ( <ask for example file>) as reference.
  - Steps:
    1. Review the top-level docstring/comments and code comments for purpose, doc links, Slack channels, env setup, how to run, etc.
    2. Improve  add/clarify comments, rename variables for clarity, and organize code sections.
    3.  Add comments for steps to help break the code into logical steps as demonstrated in the sample example file 
    4.  Do NOT alter functionality, but if it makes sense refactor teh code for simplicity and clarity. 
    5. Suggest ways students can safely tweak or experiment (e.g., changing parameters).
    6. If information is missing (dependencies, setup, etc.), ask or flag.
    7. Ensure the output is beginner-friendly and easy to read.
    8. do not add docstrings but use good names for functions & variables. 

  ### Jupyter Notebook Refactoring
  - Refactor any notebook in the directory for clarity and student learning. use the structure from an example notebook (( <ask for example notebook>) )
  - Steps:
    1. Review all relevant notebooks and Python files for context.
    2. For each notebook, ensure markdown cells have clear, meaningful descriptions of the steps/concepts.
    3. Bring in useful code from files if missing.
    4. Mark sections that are good for experimentation, suggest changes users can try.
    5. End with a markdown cell of practice exercises or discussion prompts.
    6. If anything important is missing from the notebook, ask for clarification.

  ### README Refactoring
  - Write or update the README file for a folder as a student learn-and-experiment guide. use an example readme for inspiration and structure. (( <ask for example readme>) )
  - Steps:
    1. Use a “good” README as reference (e.g., RAG README).
    2. Review all files in the folder.
    3. Cover: module/folder purpose, setup, instructions (with uv run), file descriptions, ideas for experimenting, extra resources, ensure every file is described, fix errors, and fill any gaps.
    4. Ask for missing information as needed.
    5. Encourage questions and experimentation.

  ### General Guidance
    - Keep all code and docs simple and focused on understanding, not optimization.
    - Always flag or prompt for missing info rather than guessing.
    - Directly suggest opportunities for experimentation.
    - Add/clarify top-level comments everywhere.
    - Reference docs, examples, Slack where relevant.
