Yes, here's a python code snippet:
payload = {
            "pipelineId": "my_pipeline_v1",
            "appId": app_id,

resp = requests.post(url, json=payload, timeout=120)
here's a POSTMAN example as well:

Service URL: https://puo3dsaj7csiorw4sylcndmjbe.apigateway.us-phoenix-1.oci.customer-oci.com/api/v1/aia/eceu/evaluation
Scope: https://puo3dsaj7csiorw4sylcndmjbe.apigateway.us-phoenix-1.oci.customer-oci.com/api/regular:ai-first
Access token url: https://idcs-20b69708c6f440d9b60cde3c65a0e648.identity.oraclecloud.com/oauth2/v1/
Client Secret: Please let me know the right person to receive it directly — I’ll share it privately rather than over email.
How to use above info to access services: https://gbuconfluence.oraclecorp.com/display/AIAcc/Technical+Design+-+AIA+Services+APIs#TechnicalDesignAIAServicesAPIs-AIAServiceEndpointsDetails:~:text=POST-,Authentication%20%26%20Authorization,-High%2Dlevel%20Design
Access to AIA Environment: To better support your tryout, I’ve requested “collaboration development” 6-month access for everyone in the AI First Self-Service team. This request is still pending manager approvals — you can track it here: Batch Request Link.
Once approved, team members will be able to log in to the AIA Dev tenancy via the console(access link), upload data, and run tests.
A quick reminder:
Please use the Sandbox compartment for experiments.
Avoid using the AI-Accelerator-1 and AI-Accelerator-Test compartments.
Do not create new resources (such as Dedicated AI Clusters, Database) directly without prior coordination.
Thanks, and let me know if you need any additional details!
Best,
Jessica
